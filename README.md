# About-Journey
  Hello, my name is Ashton Richardson.  I am a geek and aspiring technology professional.  Right now I’m trying to transition labbing to being a full-time professional.  I will be documenting my journey as a technology professional. I have many different interests in tech.  I like using the cloud to build infrastructure to experiment in; I’ve been doing it since I was 12.  I like writing and blogging.  I also like using programs to build things and automate tasks.  This blog aims to help others who may have difficulties figuring out what they want to do in tech or how they may use or leverage tech in whatever career they choose.  This blog will include stories of my experience and journey, technologies I use, projects I choose, and why I chose them.  The steps I use when learning new tech.  Ultimately there will also be a conclusion in the career path I choose.
